# This script creates simple gv graph representing the ADL, 
# based on the full gv graph representation.
#
# Typical Usage :
#
# for i in $(find ./build/ -name "*.gv");
#  do simplifyDot $i > $(dirname $i)"/Simple"$(basename $i);
# done 
#
# Will create a "MindViewer compatible simple gv graph set" 
# from a "MindViewer compatible full gv graph set"
